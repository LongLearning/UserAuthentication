#Basic reusable User Authentication

##Goals:
* Learn to use Rails 3
* Look into Postgres
* Create a User model
* Basic RSpec testing
* Authenticate user with device
* Create Roles
* Use CanCan for Authorization

###Workflow
1. Choose an issue you want to work on. (I'll try to create them in logical order)
2. Create a local branch (issueNumber_descriptiveName)
3. Make your changes
4. Push to origin/your_local_branch_name
5. Create on GitHub a pull request
6. Wait for my code review and make needed changes (you can start on a new issue on a different branch, if you don't need the new code to do so)
7. Merge it in GitHub.
